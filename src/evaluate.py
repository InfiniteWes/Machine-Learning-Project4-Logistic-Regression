TODO:

1. Load trained model 

2. Load test data:
   - Use utils.py to load and preprocess test set

3. Evaluate model performance:
   - Run forward pass on test data
   - Get predicted labels using argmax
   - Compute accuracy

4. Generate evaluation results:
   - Build confusion matrix
   - Maybe we should also display/save sample predictions

5. Output results:
   - Write results to Excel file with:
     - Column 1: image filenames
     - Column 2: predicted labels
     - Count of predictions per label
   - Save confusion matrix plot to outputs folder
