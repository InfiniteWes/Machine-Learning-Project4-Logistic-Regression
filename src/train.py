TODO:

1. Load training data:
   - Use utils.py to load training/validation sets; it already preprocesses the data

2. Initialize logistic regression model:
   - From model.py

3. Implement training loop:
   - Forward pass (compute predictions)
   - Compute loss (cross-entropy)
   - Backward pass (compute gradients)
   - Update weights using SGD

4. Track performance:
   - Store training/validation loss
   - Track accuracy on both sets

5. Save training results:
   - Save model to disk
   - Save training logs (loss curves, accuracy, etc.)

6. Plot learning curves:
   - Use utils.plot_results()
